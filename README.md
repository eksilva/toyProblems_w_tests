# toyProblems_w_tests

// Toy problems to solve from my time at my software bootcamp, but I wrote my own tests for each problem.

// The tests are written in Jest for now, may add some other frameworks for testing more complex problems (e.g. Enzyme for React)

// the actual problem files live in their own folder, while the testing suite has its own file.

// This repo should be viewed as a trial run for writing my own tests, and as such may include errors, or not quite best practices.
